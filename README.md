# Face Emotion Detection

This repository contains a project that implements face emotion detection using deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to classify facial expressions into predefined categories such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc., based on input images.

## Features

- Preprocessing of facial images to enhance emotion recognition.
- Deep learning model for emotion classification.
- Visualization of detected emotions.
- Implementation in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anshraz27/face_emotion_detection.git
   cd face_emotion_detection
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

## Dataset

This project uses a facial emotion dataset to train and test the model. You can use the [FER2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013) as an example. Download the dataset and place it in the project directory under a folder named `data`.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Face_emotion_detection.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells step-by-step to preprocess the data, train the model, and visualize the results.

3. Modify or extend the notebook as per your requirements.

## Model Architecture

The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for facial emotion detection. The architecture includes:

- Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- Pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.
- Fully connected layers for classification.

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy on the test set, effectively classifying emotions such as:

- Happy
- Sad
- Angry
- Neutral
- Surprised

Sample predictions and visualizations are provided in the notebook.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

Install the dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
